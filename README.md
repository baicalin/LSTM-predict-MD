# Learning Molecular Dynamics with Simple Language Model built upon Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network
This is an example showing how to use a simple [LSTM based lagnuage model](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/text_generation) to learn a Langevin dynamics of a 4-state model potential described in [Nat. Commu. **11**, 5115 (2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18959-8). Please read and cite these manuscripts if using this example:

# LSTM_LM_4s.py
This file contains all settings, data preprocessing, loss function, and the model itself. The program is tested under tensorflow/1.10.1 with keras beckend. Simpy implement this file by
```
python3 LSTM_LM_4s.py
```
in the terminal. The program will save a file with prediction and corresponding training checkpoints of last few epochs.
# lossT.py
This program uses this file as input loss function.
For using other loss, removing line 179 and return in line 182:
```
from lossT import sparse_categorical_crossentropy
def loss(labels, logits):
    return sparse_categorical_crossentropy(labels, logits, from_logits=True)
```
